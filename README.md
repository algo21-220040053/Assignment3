The assignment about Fama French Model for Algo Trading.
## Brief introduction
After the CAPM model has undergone a lot of empirical research and application, there is evidence that market risk premium cannot fully explain the rate of return of 
individual risky assets. So many researchers began to explore other factors, such as company market value. Fama and French extracted three important factors: market 
risk premium factor, market value factor and book-to-market value ratio factor, and constructed a linear model similar to CAPM, which is the famous  Fama and French Three-Factor Model.
